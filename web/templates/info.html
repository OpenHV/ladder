<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<dl id=faq>
	<dt>How can I play on the ladder?</dt>
	<dd>
		Register an OpenRA account on the <a href="https://forum.openra.net/">Community Forum</a>
		and link it with your in-game player profile. This will allow you to
		join the ladder game server lobbies (see <strong>The
		essentials</strong> section). Every game you play on these servers will
		automatically be recorded and your score adjusted on this website within
		minutes.<br>
	</dd>

	<dt>
		The opponent is bad mannered and just disconnected: do I have
		to destroy all their structures to register a win?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		No, just leave the game, but <strong>do not surrender</strong>,
		otherwise it will be registered as a loss for you.
	</dd>

	<dt>How do I get better at the game?</dt>
	<dd>
		Read <a href="https://git.libregaming.org/Rampoina/OpenHVGuide#openhv-guide">
			Rampoina's OpenHV guide</a>
		You may also want to join the <a href="https://discord.openhv.net">
			Official OpenHV Discord</a> and ask for games in the <i>Play</i> channel.
	</dd>

	<dt>
		How do I face more players in my skill class?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Unfortunately, there is currently no automatic matchmaking
		system and the community is probably still too small for a
		balanced experience of such a system.
	</dd>

	<dt>When does the ladder reset?</dt>
	<dd>
		You have a 2-months reset of the ladder (see the "This period"
		button on most pages). The "All time" representation is
		currently the persistent version of the ladder with all the
		records.
	</dd>

	<dt>Why did I earn points by losing?</dt>
	<dd>
		You probably played a strong player, and the ranking system
		doesn't have enough information to make a good guess at your
		level yet. The variation in your score will stabilize the more
		you play, and become more predictable as your level becomes
		more certain to the system.
	</dd>

	<dt>Why does my name not show up in the rankings?</dt>
	<dd>
		The scoreboards currently only display players with a <i>positive</i> rating
		assigned by the algorithm. Check if your games show up in the
		"latest games" section. If you click on your player profile name, you can check
		the rating assigned to your profile. If you are actually ranked with a negative
		rating, keep on playing. As soon as you take your first victories, the rating
		will rise and your journey on the ladder begins.
	</dd>

	<dt>Where can I report abuse?</dt>
	<dd>
		The ladder has no control over the accounts of players.
		Contacting the OpenRA forum admins is probably your best bet.
		If their account ends up being disabled, all their replays will
		go away from this website, and the scores adjusted
		automatically as if they never existed.
	</dd>

	<dt>How do I playback old replays?</dt>
	<dd>
		First, you probably need the OpenHV release that was used to
		generate the replay.
	</dd>
